## The purpose of this file is to tell git what kind of files to 
## Ignore.

# We don't want to commit executables, because they'll be different
# and possibly unusable across systems
exec/*

# Stuff in the log directory will probably change every time
# Someone runs a program
log/*

# Don't commit objects for the same reason we don't commit executables
objects/*

## The following prevents any conventionally named object file from
# 	being committed
*.slo
*.o
*.lo
*.obj


## .swp, .swo files are files generated by vim/gvim while you 
## while a file is being edited. Sometimes they can stick around
## when you don't close it properly. In any case, they shouldn't
## Make it into the repository..
*.swp
*.swo
